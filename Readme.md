Greetings, English-speaking Firewall Sentinels and Proxies!

Before we can have great character creators, we need to have great data.

This repository will host files that are necessary for robust and helpful applications to make our favorite roleplaying game more immersive, less cumbersome, and faster to launch.

But we need YOUR help
===

I've tried doing all this myself, and I made a small dent in the workload. I can't do this alone. So I ask you, agents of Firewall, to take some time out to contribute to these open source docs. If everyone contributes, we can have some amazing character generators in no time.

Not a programmer? No problem. This document will explain how to contribute.  Ask any questions on repo Gitter or find my email on Github.

How To Contribute (Manually)
====
- Fork this repository by pressing the `Fork` button in the top-right.
- Download the ZIP file this repository with the GREEN `Clone or download` button in the middle-right.
- Unzip the files on your computer and start editing them.
- Use the `Upload files` button to upload new files to your copy of the respository.
- Click a filename and click the trashcan in the middle-right to delete old files.
- Click `New Pull Request` in the middle-left when you're done and ready to send your work to this main repository.

How To Contribute (Using Git)
====

Github uses Git for "version control". What this means is, you can create a copy of this repository in your account (forking) and download it to your desktop (cloning). Then, you can update it as you wish, with whatever program you want.  After you save it, you can upload it back to your account with Git (adding, committing, and pushing) and, when you're satisfied with what you've contributed, you can submit a Pull Request to merge it back to this original repository.

To start, download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have Git installed, you need to open your terminal or command line.  On a Mac, the terminal is in Applications -> Utilities folders.  On Windows, you can press `Ctrl`+`r` and type `cmd` and hit enter to get it.

In your terminal, type `git -h`, hit enter, and see a bunch of help text.  If you see something like "git doesn't exist", head over to Gitter and grab some help.

Once you have Git installed, come back to this repository, and click the `Fork` button on the top-right.  Once you've made your fork, you'll see a page that looks a lot like this one, but instead of `gbhojraj/EclipsePhaseOpenSource`, you'll see `YourAccount/EclipsePhaseOpenSource`.  Slightly above the middle of the page is a GREEN button that says `clone or download`.
